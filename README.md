# LifeAssistant
Code in "https://github.com/KrizzyK/LifeAssistant/tree/master/app/src/main"

Android app written in Java, IDE - Android Studio.

The app is made for my own usage. It currently has few functions, such as note keeper, dictionary, counters. Currently working on "ToDoStack", 
which is a task manager, which sorts them taking in the account deadline and priority. 

This project is my second Android development project. I learned about ASyncTask, Adapters, Dialogs, Views, different kinds of layout.
I used the Room Library, which handles saving all data in the databases(SQLite). 
I also used the oxford dictionary API to get the meaning of the words in the dictionary part of the app.
